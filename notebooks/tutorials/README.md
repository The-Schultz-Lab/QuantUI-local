## How to Use

### 📖 For Self-Study

1. **Start with Tutorial 1** - Even if you're experienced
2. **Work sequentially** - Each builds on previous concepts
3. **Read explanations** - Don't just run cells
4. **Try variations** - Experiment with different molecules
5. **Check solutions** - Compare your results

### 🎓 For Classroom Use

Instructors can:
- Assign specific tutorials as homework
- Use in lab sessions with guidance
- Modify molecules for assignments
- Add questions/discussion points

### ⏱️ Suggested Schedule

- **Week 1:** Tutorial 1 (First Calculation)
- **Week 2:** Tutorial 2 (Basis Sets)
- **Week 3:** Tutorial 3 (Multiplicity) + Tutorial 4 (Charged Species)
- **Week 4:** Tutorial 5 (Comparing Results) + Final Project

---

## Prerequisites

- Access to QuantUI main notebook
- Basic understanding of:
  - Chemical formulas
  - Atomic structure
  - Basic quantum concepts (orbitals, electrons)

---

## Tips for Success

✅ **Run cells in order** - Don't skip ahead  
✅ **Read all text** - Explanations are important  
✅ **Experiment** - Try changing molecules  
✅ **Use checkpoints** - Verify before proceeding  
✅ **Ask questions** - Contact your instructor

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Jobs fail immediately  
**Solution:** Check your molecule setup in checkpoint cells

**Problem:** Can't see visualizations  
**Solution:** Ensure py3Dmol is installed (see main notebook setup)

**Problem:** Jobs stuck in PENDING  
**Solution:** Cluster may be busy - check status in main notebook

**Problem:** Different energy than expected  
**Solution:** Small differences are okay - check units and significant figures

---

## Next Steps

After completing these tutorials:
1. Use the main [quantui_interface.ipynb](../quantui_interface.ipynb) for your own calculations
2. Try the [analysis.ipynb](../analysis.ipynb) for advanced data analysis
3. Experiment with molecules from your coursework
